## When we hit https://www.techtonicgroup.com/ what happens? Don’t focus too much on architecture (Monolithic, SOA, Microservices, etc.). Try to focus more on how the web functions.

It shows msg with Attackers are try to steal your information. its not safe to go this web.
## From start to finish how does that data reach you to be rendered in the browser?
1- The browser checks  for a DNS(Domain Name System) record to find the corresponding IP address
2-Browser initiates a TCP connection with the server.
3-The browser sends an HTTP request to the web server.
4-The server handles the request and sends back a response.
5-The server sends out an HTTP response.
6-The browser displays the HTML content (for HTML responses which is the most common).

## What code is rendered in the browser?

client side code like HTML ,CSS, JavaScript.
and server side code like Python, JavasSript, SQL,Php.

## What is the server-side code’s main function?
server-side code's main function is to return or serve the information what client wants.
## What is the client-side code’s main function?

client-side code's main function is to request how they want information.
## How many instances of the client-side assets (HTML, CSS, JS, Images, etc.) are created?

In client side code scripts are embedded within and interact with the HTML of your site, selecting elements of it, then manipulating those elements to provide an interactive experience. Scripts interact with a cascading style sheet (CSS) file that styles the way the page looks. It dictates what work the server-side code is going to have to accomplish (where utility should be built around these front-end functions), and returns data that’s pulled from the site in a way that’s readable by the browser. For example: If there’s a form for updating a profile, the back end is built to pull specific data from the database to populate that form, while front-end scripts populate the form with that information. Client Scripts put less stress on the server because they don’t require processing on the server once they’re downloaded, just when post-backs are made.
“Post-backs” perform specific call-and-answers with the server-side code, and respond to the user immediately.



## How many instances of the server-side code are available at any given time?

The server-side environment that runs a scripting language is a web server. A user's request is fulfilled by running a script directly on the web server to generate dynamic HTML pages. This HTML is then sent to the client browser. It is usually used to provide interactive web sites that interface to databases or other data stores on the server.
This is different from client-side scripting where scripts are run by the viewing web browser, usually in JavaScript. The primary advantage to server-side scripting is the ability to highly customize the response based on the user's requirements, access rights, or queries into data stores.



## What is runtime?

Runtime describes software/instructions that are executed while your program is running, especially those instructions that you did not write explicitly, but are necessary for the proper execution of your code.

## How many instances of the the databases connected to the server application are created?

Web SQL.
